# Code.Explain

> AI-powered code explainer built with React and Groq (LLaMA 3.3 70B)

Paste any code snippet and get a plain-English explanation instantly. Built for CS students and developers who want to understand code faster — not just run it.

---

## Features

**Three explanation modes** — all run in parallel the moment you hit explain

- **Explain** — clear general walkthrough of what the code does and how
- **Breakdown** — structured analysis with line-by-line breakdown, key concepts, and potential gotchas
- **ELI5** — beginner-friendly explanation using real-world analogies, zero jargon

**Code analysis**

- **Complexity analysis** — time and space complexity with a one-sentence reason for each
- **Code review** — detects bugs and issues, lists optimization suggestions, and provides an improved version of your code

**Code translation** — translate your code from one language to another with a full list of changes made and why

**Multiple sessions** — open multiple tabs at once, each with its own code, results, and state

**Split view** — code on the left with line numbers, explanation on the right. Click any line to highlight it

**File upload** — drag or upload `.js`, `.py`, `.java`, `.cpp`, `.c`, `.ts`, `.rs`, `.go`, `.sql`, `.html`, `.css` files with automatic language detection

**Sample library** — 3 ready-to-run code samples for every supported language

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- A free Groq API key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/thesleepdeprivedkid/Code.Explain.git
cd Code.Explain

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create your environment file
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and add your Groq API key:

```
VITE_GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in your browser.

### Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

---

## Deployment (Vercel)

1. Push the repo to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import the repository
3. Set the framework preset to **Vite**
4. Add `VITE_GROQ_API_KEY` as an environment variable in the Vercel dashboard
5. Click Deploy

Every subsequent `git push` to `main` triggers an automatic redeployment.

## Project Structure

```
code-explainer/
├── src/
│   ├── App.jsx        # Entire application — components, state, API calls
│   └── App.css        # Empty — all styles are inline within App.jsx
├── index.html
├── vite.config.js
├── package.json
└── .env               # Not committed — add your own from .env.example
```

## How It Works

1. User pastes code or uploads a file
2. On clicking **Explain**, three API calls fire in parallel to Groq — one per mode (Explain, Breakdown, ELI5)
3. Two additional calls run for complexity analysis and code review
4. Results stream back and populate each tab as they arrive
5. The markdown renderer parses the AI response line by line into styled React elements — no external markdown library used

The Groq client is initialized using the OpenAI SDK with Groq's base URL:

```js
const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_GROQ_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://api.groq.com/openai/v1",
  dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true,
});
```

## Supported Languages

JavaScript · TypeScript · Python · Java · C++ · C · Rust · Go · SQL · HTML/CSS

---

## Known Limitations

- API key is used client-side — suitable for demos and personal use, not for public production apps with high traffic. For production, proxy API calls through a backend
- Code input capped at 8000 characters per request
- Groq free tier has rate limits — if you hit them, wait a moment and retry
